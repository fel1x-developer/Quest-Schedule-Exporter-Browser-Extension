# Quest Schedule Exporter Browser Extension

This is a browser extension that allows you to export your uWaterloo Quest schedule to an iCalendar file.

## Issue

- Manual copy and paste is required since browser handled copy and paste doesn't work well on Quest.
- End to End testing on WXT is bit tricky. Still investigating.

If you have solutions for these issues, please submit a pull request.
